# A Collection Of Toy Microservices

## Why Toy Microservices?

### Free Code Camp

I am writing these as a requirement for freecodecamp - an organization where people can learn to code, complete certifications, and then help non-profit organizations by working on web projects for them.  These microservices consist of the "API" portion of the backend certificate.  

### Experimentation With Different Languages

I am also writing these to experiment and gain exposure to various languages, from Go to Scala, to Node.js
